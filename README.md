# Clothing Retail Chain

## Overview
This project was developed as part of the course **Πληροφοριακά Συστήματα (Information Systems)** at [Harokopio University of Athens – Dept. of Informatics and Telematics](https://www.dit.hua.gr) and focuses on the analysis and redesign of the information systems architecture for a **clothing retail chain (InfiStyle)**.

The project combines **business process analysis**, **data flow diagrams (DFDs)**, and a **proposed enterprise application architecture** to highlight how modern information systems can enhance efficiency, customer experience, and competitiveness in the retail fashion industry.
